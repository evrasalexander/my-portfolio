I posses advanced communication skills, aswell as the ability to lead teams, and the ability to visualize the "bigger" picture of your finalized project. I live by the philosophy that it is far better to do things correctly the first time, rather than to rush through a project or task, only to have to come back later and resolve issues.</p>

                <p class="text-white font-size-20"> was fortunate enough to attend High School at William Mason, a very large High school in Mason Ohio where I earned my Diploma and was even able to graduate a few months early in 2012. Even in high school I couldn't help but make my own fun and take lead as I founded and managed my own after school sporting event, known as "Ye' old Nerf Wars" we met on saturdays and did glorious battle with faux melee weapons like swords and axes. I managed any where from 40-60 kids of varrying age groups and organized rounds similar to lazer tag or air soft. </p>

                <p class="text-white text-center font-size-20">Currently I am building my education further through Kable Academy's web development program, where I will learn Html, css, and Java Script. Every day is a new challenge and the sky is the limit.</p>

                <p class="text-white text-center font-size-20">  I wield a vast array of skills from my professional history. During my time as a server/bartender at Moerlein Lager House, I learned a humbling amount about how to interect with respect and apprecitation for other people of all walks of life, conquering language barriers, working in large teams to push through rushes or local events, aswell as slowing down and changing tempo to match more formal "Banquet" occasions like wedding receptions and business gatherings, and providing excellent customer service for all people was an everyday part of the job and a socially enriching experience that gave me skills I have been able to apply in all aspects of my life and especially other career paths.

                    <p class="text-white text-center font-size-20">
                    After sometime I knew I needed another challenge and an opportunity fell into my lap to join a prestigious group of knights known as the Knights of Valour! Based in Cincinnati Ohio and if you have ever been to the local Renaissance Festival and watched the joust take place then you know exactly who I'm talking about. The man in charge Shane Adams is a brilliant jousting knight and also was the host of the hit show Full Metal Jousting on the history channel. In my time spent as a squire working for the Knights of Valour I learned a deep respect for horses aswell as for the agricultural industry and how much work goes into maintaining a stable and herd of horses. My education did not stop there however, I was taught to ride as well as equip the gear and barding for those beautiful percheron war horses by the equestrian Armondo Lacayo. I was also trained in different cavalry battle tactics aswell as to hit targets with a lance or thrown javelin at speed from horseback, and other forms of melee weapon based martial combat and armor training. I traveled with them accross the country, Michigan, New Mexico, the Mojave Desert in Nevada, Colorado, Los Angeles California, Illinois, Utah etc. I learned so much about the world outside of Ohio aswell as traveling and hauling a horse trailer full of war horses and the amount of care and attention they need during travel. It was an incredible and enriching experience I would not trade for anything and it has given me a very uniqe percpective in life. Charge on!
                    </p>
    
                    <p class="text-white text-center font-size-20">
                    As much as I loved working with horses and the knowledge I had gained, I knew this was not my final stop in life. So once our tour was over I decided to take another opportunity and I moved out to Nashville Tennessee, where I entered the miraculous world of large scale commercial construction. I started my journey in the construction world in the Sheet Metal trade, I was taught how to assemble and install metal air duct systems and how to cut and craft custom duct pieces. As I excelled there was a need for Plumbers so I volunteered to cross-train into the plumbing trade and I took off with it! From soldering and brazing various sizes of copper pipe, to installing victolic steel pipe, cast iron, PVC, or working in the trench to install the primary drain lines underground, I believe that leaks are a choice and if you take your time and do the job correctly you will almost never have issues later on during the project. Once all the sheet-rock and dry-wall goes in, it becomes much more difficult to repair or mend leaky pipes. Due to my natural skill and extremley low leak ratio the next natural step for me was Refridgeration systems, a more delicate process involving the bending of soft copper and hooking up advanced refridgeration cooling and heating systems and units. Got a leak under the sink? I can fix that.
